//! Defines the named standard illuminants for both 2 and 10 degree observers
//!
//! White point is used in many situations when dealing with color, as color perception changes
//! depending on the lighting of the object being viewed. A white point is needed to define
//! a color space (and thus go to XYZ) as well as to go from XYZ to Lab and Luv.
//!
//! CIE defines two "standard observers", which are used to construct the XYZ space. The 2 degree
//! observer is the most often used, and corresponds to the perception in the center 2 degree field
//! of view of the eye. A later 10 degree observer was created to model perception in a 10 degree
//! field of view excluding the inner 2 degrees. It is recommended for use when a larger field of view
//! needs to be considered. The 2 degree observer white points are re-exported. Note that the 2 and 10
//! degree standard observers use fundamentally different color-matching functions, which means that
//! they yield different XYZ spaces. It is not valid (without spectrographic data) to convert between
//! a 2 degree standard observer XYZ space and a 10 degree standard observer XYZ space.
//!
//! The standard illuminants are slightly different between the two, so prisma provides two modules
//! containing them `deg_2` and `deg_10`. If you don't know which to use, use `deg_2`.
